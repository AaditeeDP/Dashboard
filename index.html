	<p class=p5>The factors that determine the profit earned by the company according to us are as follows :
		<ol class='p5'>
			<li><h4><i> Revenue </i></h4> <p> Revenue is the income generated from normal business operations and includes discounts and deductions for returned merchandise. It is the top line or gross income figure from which costs are subtracted to determine net income. </p>
			</li>

			<li><h4><i> Gross Margin </i></h4> <p>Gross margin is the difference between revenue and cost of goods sold, divided by revenue. Gross margin is expressed as a percentage. Generally, it is calculated as the selling price of an item, less the cost of goods sold, then divided by the same selling price </p>
			</li>

			<li><h4><i> Units Sold </i></h4> <p>Higher the number of sales, more is the profit earned</p>
			</li>

			<li><h4><i> Frequency of ordering </i></h4> <p> Higher the frequency of order, more is the relability and accountability that the company will continue to buy products, increasing the sales and profits </p>
			</li>

		</ol> </p>
